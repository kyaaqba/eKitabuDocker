<p>Goose flew for one day, straight over the highest mountains in the world. Eagle flew for two days, into the sky high above the mountains. But Vulture soared for three whole days without stopping, straight toward the sun. Far above them, the birds heard Vulture cry, "I am the highest, I am king!"</p>
