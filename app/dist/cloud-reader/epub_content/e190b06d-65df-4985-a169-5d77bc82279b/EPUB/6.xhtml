<div class="books levelFont5">One scorching day, a young girl called Ketti decided to go into the forest after school. "At least it will be cool in there," she thought to herself. She walked and walked, and after some time, she came to the tall tree in which the rain bird lived. Ketti stared up at the tree. Suddenly, she remembered how her granny had taken her into the forest to feed the bird when she was still a tiny child. Ketti opened her school bag and pulled out a piece of bread left over from her lunch. Carefully she laid the bread at the base of the tree. Then, because she had no thumb piano with her, she sang an old song that she had known all her life.</div>
