<div class="books levelFont5">As Anansi walked by Warthog's house, he smelled sweet potatoes. Warthog told Anansi, "My pot is full of sweet potatoes and honey! Come and share my food with me. Take this fork and help me to stir it." Anansi replied, "I'll come back later. Let me tie one end of this web around my leg and one end to your pot. When the sweet potatoes are ready, pull on the web string, and I'll come."</div>
