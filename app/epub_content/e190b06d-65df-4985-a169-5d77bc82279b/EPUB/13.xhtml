<div id="container"><img src="images/2168.png" alt="Half an hour later, Ketti was back at the base of the big tree. A few paces away from her lay the lifeless body of her father. Ketti looked away quickly, and with trembling hands, began to play the thumb piano. She played and played, until her fingers hurt."/></div>

<div class="books levelFont5">"I'll teach that disobedient child a lesson!" he said to himself angrily. He snatched his bow and arrows and silently followed Ketti into the forest. Just as the bird flew down to eat the food that Ketti had set out for it, her father raised his bow and released his deadly arrow. The arrow flew straight into the bird's heart. The bird let out a piercing shriek. Terrified, Ketti spun around − just in time to see her father fall down, stone dead. Ketti screamed and turned around − just in time to see the arrow fall harmlessly from the bird's glossy body. Then the bird, unharmed, swooped up into the highest branch of the tree.</div>
