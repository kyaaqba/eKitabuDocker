<div id="container"><img src="images/2163.png" alt="A beautiful blue bird swooped out of the branches above Ketti's head and began to eat the bread, she opened her mouth and sang a few pure, high notes. Then she raised her shiny wings and all of a sudden Ketti heard the rumble of thunder. By the time she reached her home, giant rain drops were pelting down, cooling the baking red earth."/></div>
