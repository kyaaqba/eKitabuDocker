<div class="books levelFont5">Ketti was very happy, until she told her parents what had happened. "Don't be silly!" scolded her mother. "Nobody believes that bird has anything to do with the rain anymore!" "Your mother is right," said Ketti's father. "The drought has been broken now and we will be fine. Don't go wasting good bread feeding that greedy old bird again!" Though Ketti didn't argue with her parents, she felt sure they were wrong. "If only Granny were still alive," she said to herself, "she would have believed me!" But Ketti's granny had died a few years earlier.
