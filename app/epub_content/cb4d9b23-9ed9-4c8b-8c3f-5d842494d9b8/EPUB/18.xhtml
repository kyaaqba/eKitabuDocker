<div class="books levelFont5">The first chicken spread its wings and flew onto Mme Ngwe's bosom. Mme Pedi next to her started giggling. Another chicken flew up onto Mme Ngwe's new duku. The people at the next table tried not to laugh. The lady next to Mme Ngwe put her head down onto the table, "Ai, aai, aaaaii, he, he, heeeeeeee!" she cackled. All the other chickens decided to join the first two. You couldn't see Mme Ngwe for all those chickens!</div>
