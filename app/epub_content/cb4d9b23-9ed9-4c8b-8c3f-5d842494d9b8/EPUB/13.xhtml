<div class="books levelFont5">Mme Pedi decided to make her famous pumpkin dish. She took her big bowl and went off to the vegetable garden. In the vegetable garden she saw Mme Ngwe's bundle under the pumpkin vine. She undid the bundle. Out fell all eight chickens. "Eish!" she cried jumping back in surprise. "Oh, you are the cleanest, prettiest chickens! Just ready for my pot," she crooned. "Now, where shall I hide you my darlings?" Mme Pedi chuckled, "I'll have to find a very good place," she said walking round the house. "I know," she said at last, "I'll put you on the roof!" Mme Pedi climbed up onto the garden wall and put the chickens in a row on the thatched roof.</div>
