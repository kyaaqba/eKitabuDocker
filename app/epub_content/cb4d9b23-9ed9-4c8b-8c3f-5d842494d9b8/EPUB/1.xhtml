<div class="books levelFont5">It was the first wedding in the Tenane family, and Refiloe had never been so excited in her life. "I'm going to be Palesa's bridesmaid, with a new dress and shoes!" she said to her chickens. Refiloe told her chickens everything. Her father had given the chickens to her as a birthday present, and she loved them very much.</div>
