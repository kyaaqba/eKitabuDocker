<div class="books levelFont5">The guests screamed with laughter. The men had to hold onto their bellies. The women rolled around in their chairs. The boys and girls were hanging onto each other. The grandmothers could hardly breathe for laughing. The grandfathers stamped their walking sticks. Then the two aunts looked at each other and started giggling. Mme Pedi opened her mouth wide with laughter. Mme Ngwe threw back her head and laughed until all her chins shook. Refiloe couldn't believe it!</div>
